# EinfachDeutsch: a game to learn German and Catalan
This repository includes the mini-game to learn both Deutsch and Catalan. There are the main scripts and the `.csv` dictionaries with which the game operates.

It is a simple game that asks you to write the aricle, the plural, the meaning, the conjugation or the translation between the two languages. It is based on the vocabulary for the german coursebook at the Escola Oficial d'Idiomes of Barcelona. To start the game in Linux, simply clone the repository, open a terminal in that folder and run:

`./Spieler.py`

Feel free to report any bug or collaborate to make it better!
